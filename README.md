It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

However, I’ve drafted the complete professional `README.md` content for your **GyanPath** project below. You can copy and paste it directly into your project’s `README.md` file:

# GyanPath 🧭

**GyanPath** is a full-stack indoor navigation solution built for **Gyan Ganga Institute of Technology and Sciences (GGITS)**, enabling users—students, faculty, and visitors—to easily find and navigate to any classroom, department, or facility using the shortest path possible. Inspired by the functionality of Google Maps, this system is optimized for **multi-floor indoor environments** and delivers a seamless, real-time experience.

---

## 🚀 Why GyanPath?

Large educational campuses like GGITS can be challenging to navigate, especially for new students and guests. GyanPath addresses this by providing:

* 📍 Accurate real-time positioning within campus buildings.
* 🧭 Step-by-step shortest route guidance to any classroom or location.
* 🗺️ Multi-floor indoor map navigation.
* 🔄 Live updates using WebSockets for a responsive user experience.

This project is tailored to GGITS but can be extended to any indoor navigation context such as malls, hospitals, corporate campuses, etc.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture

GyanPath follows a **modular, maintainable, and industry-standard architecture**:

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

### 🖥️ Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+ recommended)
* MongoDB instance (local or cloud)
* Vite (comes bundled via `npm`)
* Git

### 🧩 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GyanPath.git
cd GyanPath

# Install Client dependencies
cd Client
npm install

# Install Server dependencies
cd ../Server
npm install
```

### 🔑 Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `Server/src/` with the following (example):

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/gyanpath
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
PORT=5000
```

### 🚦 Running the App

```bash
# Run the backend
cd Server
npm start

# In a separate terminal, run the frontend
cd ../Client
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` to access the app.

## ✨ Key Features

* 📌 **Geolocation-based routing**
* 🗺️ **Interactive indoor maps**
* 🧠 **Smart shortest-path algorithm**
* 🧭 **Real-time updates with WebSocket**
* 🧱 **Multi-floor support with FloorSelector**
* 🔍 **Live search with debounce**
* 🔐 **User authentication & roles**
* ⚙️ **RESTful API with modular routes**

---

## 🧑‍💻 Why This Codebase Stands Out

* ✅ **Highly modular**: Components, logic, and services are separated for easy debugging and scalability.
* ✅ **Maintainable**: Clean folder structure, naming conventions, reusable utilities.
* ✅ **Production ready**: Middleware for error handling, auth, logs, and socket management.
* ✅ **Best practices**: Follows MVC, layered architecture, DRY principle, and React best practices.
* ✅ **Real-time architecture**: WebSocket integration allows future extensibility like live location tracking, updates, or multi-user navigation.

---

## 🏁 Roadmap & Future Scope

* 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Multi-user tracking
* 🛠️ Admin panel to upload floorplans
* 📱 Mobile app with QR-based room scanning
* 🧠 AI-based crowd-aware routing
